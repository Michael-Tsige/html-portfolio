<h3>The Best of Me  - 2014</h3>
<p>This movie was heart touching. I saw it at a perfect time, when I needed 
    to see passion and love in the world. It a romance that its written so well, 
    it makes you feel like its you in the story. If you are the type that believes 
    everything is meant to be, then I highly recommend.

<h3>Narcos  - series</h3>
<p>A true story about big drug empires, especially the one about Pablo Escobar, simply 
    put, the Bill Gates of Cocaine in the 1980's. Its true, the movie seems soo real 
    and narriated well. Great acting by Pedro Pascal in this 3 season series.

<h3>Instant Family  - 2018</h3>
<p>It has been a while since I've seen this. It is a true story about a regular loving 
    couple adapting foster children who were the least likely to be chosen by others. 
    It shows the struggle faced by both parents and children in the adoption process. 
    But also shows the beauty and joy that comes through all the struggle.
